title: 'A great batch of cookies'
---
I often make cookies with some variations on the ingredients.

Today's batch was good, so here's the recipe<!--more-->:

- 250g wheat flour (half pain white flour, half wholemeal)
- 75g oat flakes
- 150g butter (salted)
- 80g sugar
- 1 egg
- chocolate chips
- 1/2 sachet of baking powder (~ 8g)
- 1/2 sachet of vanilla sugar (~ 4g)

Make sure the butter is soft enough by either taking it out of the fridge in advance or microwaving it.

Mix all ingredients with your hands (butter and flour won't mix well if you only use a spoon). If after mixing, the dough is too dry (i.e. some of the flour refuses to stick with the rest of the dough), add a very small amount of milk.

Taste and adjust, e.g. if you prefer your cookies sweeter.

The egg is not mandatory but it helps the cookies raise.

Make balls and flatten them with your hands on a baking paper.

Cook 190Â°C/15 minutes.

Enjoy!
